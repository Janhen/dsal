[696. Count Binary Substrings](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-binary-substrings/description/)

统计二进制字符串中连续 1 和连续 0 数量相同的子字符串个数
0 和1 连续, 总个数相同


Input: "00110011"
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 substrings that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's: "0011", "01", "1100", "10", "0011", and "01".

Notice that some of these substrings repeat and are counted the number of times they occur.

Also, "00110011" is not a valid substring because all the 0's (and 1's) are not grouped together.
Example 2:
Input: "10101"
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 substrings: "10", "01", "10", "01" that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's.*/
