// medium
// array, two pointers, binary search

// Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s,
// find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the 【sum ≥ s】. 
If there isn't one, return 0 instead.

最短的子数组和为给定数

Input: s = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the recursiont_dp constraint.
