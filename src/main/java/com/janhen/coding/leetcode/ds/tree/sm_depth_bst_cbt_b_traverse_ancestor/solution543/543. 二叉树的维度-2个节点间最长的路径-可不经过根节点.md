**二叉树的维度_两个节点间最长的路径可不经过根节点**
[543. Diameter of Binary Tree(Easy)](https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/)
```
Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. 
The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. 
This path may or may not pass through the root.

Given a binary tree 
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5    
Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

Note: The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.
```

思路一: 等价于为每个节点添加 "diameter" 属性: 子树中相距最远的两个节点之间边的个数
相距最远等价于高度，此是高度与边数的一定等价特性
