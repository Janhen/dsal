 数组中在 k 范围差内是否有相同的数

 Given an array of integers and an integer k,
 find out whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that nums[i] = nums[j]
 and the absolute difference between i and j is at most k.

```html
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3
Output: true
Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1], k = 1
Output: true
Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1,2,3], k = 2
Output: false
```
