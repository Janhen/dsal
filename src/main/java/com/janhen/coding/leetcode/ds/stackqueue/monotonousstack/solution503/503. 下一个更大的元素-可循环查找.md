[503. Next Greater Element II(Medium)](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-ii/)

```
仿循环数组中每个元素下一个更大的元素

Given a circular array (the next element of the last element is the first element of the array),

print the Next Greater Number for every element.

The Next Greater Number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array,

which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, output -1 for this number.

Input: [1,2,1]
Output: [2,-1,2]
Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2;
The number 2 can't find next greater number;
The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.
