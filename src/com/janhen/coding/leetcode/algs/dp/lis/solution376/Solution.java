  //For every position in the array, there are only three possible statuses for it.

  //up position, it means nums[i] > nums[i-1]
  //down position, it means nums[i] < nums[i-1]

  //So we can use two arrays up[] and down[] to record the max wiggle sequence length so far at index i.
  //If nums[i] > nums[i-1], that means it wiggles up. the element before it must be a down position. so up[i] = down[i-1] + 1; down[i] keeps the same with before.
  //If nums[i] < nums[i-1], that means it wiggles down. the element before it must be a up position. so down[i] = up[i-1] + 1; up[i] keeps the same with before.
  //If nums[i] == nums[i-1], that means it will not change anything becasue it didn't wiggle at all. so both down[i] and up[i] keep the same.
  //
  //In fact, we can reduce the space complexity to O(1), but current way is more easy to understanding.
