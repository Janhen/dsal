[594. Longest Harmonious Subsequence(Easy)](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-harmonious-subsequence/)

最长和谐序列
和谐序列中最大数和最小数之差正好为 1，应该注意的是序列的元素不一定是数组的连续元素

We define a harmounious array as an array where the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value is exactly 1.

Now, given an integer array, you need to find the length of its longest harmonious subsequence among all its possible subsequences.

```
Input: [1,3,2,2,5,2,3,7]
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest harmonious subsequence is [3,2,2,2,3].
