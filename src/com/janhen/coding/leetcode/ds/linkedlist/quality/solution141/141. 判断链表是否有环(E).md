[141. Linked List Cycle(Easy)](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)

2817 468

Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the
linked list where tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

```html
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
3  ->  2  ->  0  ->  -4
       ^              |
       |--------------|
       
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
```
