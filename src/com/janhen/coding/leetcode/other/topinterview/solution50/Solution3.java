recursion, power reduction; binaryï¼ŒO(logn)
1. n is a positive even number, such as n=4, that is, 2^4=2*2*2*2, which can be disassembled as (2*2)^(n/2)
2. n is a positive odd number, such as n=3, that is, 2^3=2*2*2, which can be disassembled as 2*((2*2)^(n-1/2))
note:
when n is a negative number, the  recursion is  1/(myPow(x,-n)),
but if n is 2^31-1,  the  -n  will overflow, so use -(n+1) to avoid this and then multiply Just once x to maintain we didnt change the number
